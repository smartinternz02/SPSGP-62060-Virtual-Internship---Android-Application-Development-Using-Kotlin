Virtual Internship - Android Application Development Using Kotlin by SmartBridge & GOOGLE in collaboration with AICTE

Presenting the project Nearby Store & Grocery List to you!

Final Project
------------

Although I'm making a lot of effort to fix the flaws, the Maps part of the app is currently not functioning as intended. As a result, I added a grocery list project to the same app, which is completely functional. You can check it out here. Excellent user interface and functionality.
